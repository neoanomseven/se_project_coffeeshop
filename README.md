# Project 2: Triple Peaks Library

The Triple Peaks Library webpage is the second project in the Software Engineering
program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on a design brief.

## Project features
It covers essential topics such as BEM (Block Element Modifier) methodology, Git and GitHub workflows, embedding content, and key CSS techniques including transitions, transformations, forms, and animations. By the end of this guide, you will have both theoretical understanding and practical examples to apply directly in your projects.

BEM (Block Element Modifier) is a methodology for writing clean, structured, and reusable CSS code. It was introduced by Yandex to standardize how developers name CSS classes.

Concepts of Block, Element, Modifier

Block: An independent entity that represents a standalone component (e.g., button, header, form).

Element: A part of a block that performs a specific function (e.g., button__icon, form__label).

Modifier: A flag or variation that changes the look or behavior of a block or element (e.g., button--large, header--dark).

Naming Conventions

Block: .block

Element: .block__element

Modifier: .block--modifier or .block__element--modifier

GitHub is a hosting platform for Git repositories. It adds collaboration tools such as issue tracking, pull requests, and project boards.

Repositories

A repository (repo) is a storage space for your project. It contains code, documentation, and Git history.

Branches

A branch allows you to work on new features without affecting the main codebase.

Embedding Content

Embedding allows us to include external or internal content in a webpage.

CSS Transitions

Transitions allow smooth changes between CSS property values.

Forms in HTML & CSS

CSS Animations

Animations allow complex, keyframe-based effects.

Animation Properties

animation-name: Name of keyframes.

animation-duration: Length of animation.

animation-timing-function: Speed curve.

animation-delay: Delay before starting.

animation-iteration-count: Number of times it runs.

animation-direction: normal, reverse, alternate.
